# Readable API Server

This is the backend API server provided by Udacity's team for the content and comment web app project.
Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments.
Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Make the Necessary Installations

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `create-react-app frontend`
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
